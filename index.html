    <h1>Howdy Everybody</h1>
    <p>We need dark in order to show light. Only God can make a tree - but you can paint one. And maybe, maybe, maybe...
        Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals. It's life. It's interesting. It's fun.
        Van Dyke Brown is a very nice brown, it's almost like a chocolate brown. I thought today we would do a happy
        little picture. In painting, you have unlimited power. You have the ability to move mountains. I want everbody
        to be happy. That's what it's all about.
    </p>
    <p>Tree trunks grow however makes them happy. And maybe a little bush lives there. A thin paint will stick to a
        thick paint. Those great big fluffy clouds. Let's build an almighty mountain. We'll play with clouds today. You
        create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy.
    </p>
    <p>Learn when to stop. We'll do another happy little painting. Isn't it great to do something you can't fail at? We
        spend so much of our life looking - but never seeing. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of.
        You have that power. You can spend all day playing with mountains. It's a super day, so why not make a beautiful
        sky? Just use the old one inch brush. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to
        you to make friends with the little rascals. Working it up and down, back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. A fan brush can be your best friend. A beautiful
        little sunset. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. We need a
        shadow side and a highlight side. A fan brush is a fantastic piece of equipment. Use it. Make friends with it.
        Everybody needs a friend. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun
    </p>
    <p>
        Oh, green water... oh that's pretty. Boy, I like that, just alive with algae. That's where the crows will sit.
        But we'll have to put an elevator to put them up there because they can't fly, but they don't know that, so they
        still try. Water's like me. It's laaazy... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things. As my son
        Steve says, just 'smoosh' it in there. It's not a real word, but people seem to know what it means. The only
        thing worse than yellow snow is green snow. I taught my son to paint mountains like these, and guess what? Now
        he paints the best darn mountains in the industry. And that makes it look like birch trees, isn't that sneaky?
        Heh. Ha. It's gorgeous. If you did this with blue, and you went over it with yellow, you would end up with a
        nice green sky. And that's not the thing we are looking for. That's a crooked tree. We'll send him to
        Washington. Let's do a little cabinectomy here. Tender as a mothers love... And with my mother, that was
        certainly true. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can
        do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe.
    </p>
    <p>
        Well, the little clock on the wall says we're just about out of time. God bless you my friend. Any time ya
        learn,
        ya gain. When I was teaching my son Steve to paint, I used to tell him, just pretend he was a whisper, and he
        floated right across the mountain, that easy, gentle, make love to it, caress it. And that makes it look like
        birch trees, isn't that sneaky? Heh. Ha. It's gorgeous. We don't make mistakes, we just have happy accidents.
        Haha, and just beat the devil out of it. Clouds are very, very free. This is the hardest part of this method. If
        you can do this, you can do anything. We want happy paintings. Happy paintings. If you want sad things, watch
        the news. As my son Steve says, just 'smoosh' it in there. It's not a real word, but people seem to know what it
        means.
